# A6 - Emoji Argument

## Traffic Jam Simulation - Argument
Ever wonder why traffic jams occur seemingly out of nowhere? Even when there aren't any accidents, roadwork, or anything at all? Chances are, the reason for that is simply just human error. Even when you're trying to maintain your distance and keep a constant speed and acceleration as everyone else on the road, you're bound to slow down or speed up a just little bit more than you intended. These variations in speed from one car to another will inevitably cause a car to brake, even if it's just a little bit, making each successive car behind it brake more strongly than the last. This creates a wave of braking that creates sections of stop and go traffic. In this simulation, I'm trying to show how the minute changes in speed drivers make can create a large impact in the overall flow of traffic. 

## Traffic Jam Simulation - Reflection
I feel like my simulation faithfully demonstrates the phenomena of phantom traffic well, it's easy to see the shockwave effects that occur from speed variation and a counter example where there is no speed variation provides expected results. However, human behavior is a very finicky thing to simulate. There's multiple things that go into traffic behavior that was overlooked and simplified, such as driver politeness, defensive driving practices, different car accelerations, etc. There's also some bugs that couldn't be fixed and features that I wanted to add, but in the interest of time I had to ignore for the time being. Despite this, I'm really glad to see how it turned out!
