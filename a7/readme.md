# A7 - Array of Floats 

## Expressive Space
My "catification" algorithm makes Rorscach ink blot-esque shapes, which are ink blot shapes that are (somewhat controversially) used to assess psychological conditions. It's also the namesake of one of my favorite comic book characters. The landmarks are what I see in the shapes, but as with the nature of the test, you could be seeing something completely different! 

## Sliders 
- Spread: Increases the horizontal space the ink blot takes up.
- Size: Increase the overall size of the ink blot  
- Sharpness: Increases the pointiness of lumps in the ink blot
- Complexity: Increases the amount of lumps in the ink blot.
- Center Push: This one is a little difficult to explain, but in essence it increases the distance of points away from the center of the inkblot.
- Inversion: Increases the size of the inner hole that the inkblots have. If the inversion amount exceeds the size of the actual inkblot, then the inner hole becomes part of the ink blot.
